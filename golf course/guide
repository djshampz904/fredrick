Understand the Problem: The first step is to thoroughly read and understand the case study. Make sure you understand the business context, the problem at hand, and the requirements. In this case, you are tasked with building a decision model for a golf resort with a standard clubhouse, an exclusive clubhouse, and three options for the exclusive clubhouse.
Identify Decision Variables: The decision variables are the unknowns that the model seeks to determine. In this case, the decision variables could be the number and types of golf holes, the size of the clubhouse, and the total construction cost.
Identify the Objective Function: The objective function is the quantity to be minimized or maximized. In this case, the objective function could be to maximize the golfer enjoyment index while staying within the budget and land constraints.
Identify Constraints: Constraints are limitations or restrictions imposed on any solution. In this case, constraints could include the total budget, the total land available, the number of golf holes, and the international golfing requirements.
Formulate the Mathematical Model: Write the objective function and constraints as mathematical expressions. This will form the basis of your decision model.
Implement the Model in Excel: Use Excel and Solver to implement your decision model. You will need to create a spreadsheet that represents your decision variables, objective function, and constraints. Then, use Solver to find the optimal solution.
Analyze the Results: Once you have the solution, analyze the results. Look at the configuration of the golf holes, the total enjoyment index, the total land used, and the total construction cost. Compare the results for the standard clubhouse, the exclusive clubhouse, and the three options for the exclusive clubhouse.
Write the Business Report: Write a business report outlining your analysis and recommendations. The report should describe the implementation of your decision models, provide an analysis of the results, and make a recommendation. Be sure to justify your recommendation based on the international golfing requirements and the shareholders' requirements.
Review and Refine: Review your work and refine as necessary. Make sure your models are correctly implemented, your analysis is thorough, and your report is clear and persuasive.
