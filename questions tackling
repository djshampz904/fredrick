For question 3(a), you need to apply the Basic Timestamp Ordering (BTO) algorithm to schedules S1 and S2. The BTO algorithm works by assigning a timestamp to each transaction and ensuring that the transactions execute in timestamp order. If a transaction tries to execute out of order, it is rolled back and restarted.  For question 3(b), you need to test the serializability of S1 and S2 using the serialization graph technique. This involves creating a graph where each node represents a transaction and an edge from Ti to Tj indicates that Ti must execute before Tj. If the graph has no cycles, the schedule is serializable.  For the deductive database questions, you need to construct fact predicates based on the given information, then use these facts to interpret the rules and answer the questions. For example, for the question about reachability between cities, you could use the REACHABLE rule to determine if there is a path from one city to another.  For the question about the new flight and the updated model theoretic interpretation, you would add the new flight to your fact predicates and update your interpretation accordingly.  For the question about the REACHABLE_AND_DURATION rule, you would need to use the given facts and the rule to prove that REACHABLE_AND_DURATION(bne, del, 19) is true.  For the final question, you would need to write a new rule and a query based on that rule to find the cities that are reachable in less than 20 hours of flights from Delhi.
