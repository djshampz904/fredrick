Algorithm
Apriori or FP-growth
Things to consider
Ensure all attributes are nominal
Ensure zero (or absence or negative or unimportant) value does not dominate the result
Remove zeros
Demo: BookClub
Possible scenarios
Explore how preprocessing affects the results and report
NumericToBinary
Discretize
Explore multi-level (hierarchical ARM)
Demo with the crime data

Algorithm
k-means & DBSCAN & Hierarchical
Possible scenarios
For a dataset with labels
Explore how pre-processing affects the clustering results
Demo: with the iris dataset (k-means vs. cfssubseteval vs. PCs)
Explore how parameter tuning affects the clustering results
Different number of seeds (the effect of seeds), different k
For a dataset without labels
We don’t know the number of k here
Explore how to choose the best value k using the k-means for a chosen dataset
Use the within cluster sum squared errors (might be k from 1 to 10)
Draw a distribution when the errors drop suddenly
Or explore the dataset to find any interesting patterns

Algorithm
1R, J48, Ibk, MultilayerPerceptron, SMO, NaïveBayes
Things to consider
Ensure the dataset has a label attribute
Possible scenarios
Explore how preprocessing affects the results and report
How dimension reduction or attribution selection affects the results and classification efficiency for a certain classifier (or multiple classifiers)
Compare and contrast classification accuracy with various classifiers to see which performs well for a certain dataset and you derive your justifications for why is that?
